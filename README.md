# express-rest-api
Basic example of a REST API using Node/Express.js

Example creates a list of 9 users into an array.

Run the server by running node .
Access all users with get request to /users/
Access a specific user by get request to /user/ID

Add a user to the array by doing a post request to /user/ with a JSON body of user object with a name key and string value.

Uses ckey to access .env access (I commited without the .gitignore, whoops)
